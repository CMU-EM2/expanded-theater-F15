IJWTWSIDHS is an experience combining immersive video, spatialized audio, ASMR, and reactive visual effects. Victims enter a cacophonous environment filled with shards of internet detritus—a browser in exploded view—navigating this disorienting noise to find areas where the swirling fragments around them coalesce into palm trees. The permeable tree trunks provide refuge in a shivering cocoon of polygons and a soothing ASMR soundtrack.
