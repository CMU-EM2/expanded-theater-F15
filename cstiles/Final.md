In this piece the user can walk around a physical space to explore a virtual reactive environment. The environment is inspired by the feeling of infinity that one feels when they are alone in a large open space. Open spaces have historically been marked as places for contemplation. 

Although a vast space is projected, the user is still confined to a 13' by 11' box. The walls are limiting and at the same time they are the window into the environment. To counter but also highlight the duality  the scale of the user's steps are altered in the environment; one step in the physical world equates to 10 steps in the virtual world. 

The environment was made in Unity with found assets and altered scripts along with 3d models we made. Movement of the user is detected using a Kinect along with the [KVL Kinect Tracker v20](http://www.zacharyseldess.com/KVL_KinectTracker/) & a simple Max MSP patch that sends the signal via OSC to Unity.
